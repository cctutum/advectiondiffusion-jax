Simulate the advection-diffusion equations with finite difference and calculate gradients automatically with JAX,
in order to find which simulation input parameters lead to 'worst-case' pollution scenario.


Run the code in the command line with:

```console
python advection_diffusion.py
```

Simulation result:
